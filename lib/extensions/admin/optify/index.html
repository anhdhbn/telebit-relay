  <body>

  <h1>Optify</h1> 
  <p>containerize without the container</p>

  <p>Holds your hand without being so hands on.
  Like brew and Docker had a baby that <em>did</em> care about versions and <em>didn't</em> care about port numbers.
  Only for the masters of their domain.
  Be wise and be bold.</p>
